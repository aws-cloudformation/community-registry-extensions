# AWS CloudFormation Community Registry Extensions

This repository hosts [registry extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html)
that are published under the `AwsCommunity::` namespace in AWS CloudFormation.
The CloudFormation Registry allows customers to create public and private
[resources
types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html),
[modules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/modules.html),
and
[hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/hooks.html).
Modules are authored as templates in either JSON or YAML. Resource types and
hooks can be authored in Java, Go, Python, or Typescript, using the
[CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CFN
CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudformation-cli.html)
for project setup and testing.

## Open Discussions

This repository is part of an initiative to improve open source community
engagement around Infrastructure as Code at AWS. We are still in early phases,
so we would like community input on the direction we take.

* Linting. Hooks and resources can be authored in a variety of languages.
  Should we enforce a coding standard at the top level for all projects (for
  example, a single .pylintrc)? Or let each project dictate its own standards?
* What’s our “swim lane”? Do we allow contributions that patch gaps in
  CloudFormation resource coverage, which may later be handled by the AWS
  service team? Do we allow someone to basically re-write an AWS resource from
  scratch, for example AwsCommunity::S3::Bucket with different behavior from
  the original?
* Experimental extensions. Do we have a variation on the namespace to give
  people freedom to experiment? AwsCommunityAlpha:: ? There may be a registry
  feature coming soon to give a resource an ‘Alpha’ badge or ‘GA’ badge, and
  also another high level category in the middle of “AWS” and “3rd Party”. We
  want to avoid a situation where customers install experimental extensions in
  production and then get surprised by a breaking change because it wasn't
  obvious.

## How to use these extensions

(Note that we are not yet actually publishing the extensions, pending approval 
of our release process)

Log in to your AWS account and go to the CloudFormation console. Under Registry
in the menu, select Public extensions. Search under Third Party publishers for
the AwsCommunity:: namespace. These extensions can be used from any template
you author in a region where they are available and activated. Unlike public
extensions under the AWS:: namespace, each of these community extensions must
first be activated using the instructions
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html).

## Catalog of community extensions

|Name|Type|Version|Description|
|----|----|-------|-----------|
|[AwsCommunity::S3::BucketNotification](./resources/S3_BucketNotification)|Resource|Alpha|Configure bucket notifications|
|[AwsCommunity::S3::DeleteBucketContents](./resources/S3_DeleteBucketContents)|Resource|Alpha|Delete all objects in a bucket|
|[AwsCommunity::S3::BucketVersioningEnabled](./hooks/S3_BucketVersioningEnabled)|Hook|Alpha|Validate that an AWS::S3::Bucket has versioning enabled|
|[AwsCommunity::CloudFront::LoggingEnabled](./hooks/CloudFront_LoggingEnabled)|Hook|Alpha|Validate that a CloudFront distribution has logging enabled|
