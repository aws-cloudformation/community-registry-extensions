# AWS CloudFormation Community Registry Extensions

This repository hosts [registry extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html)
that are published under the `AwsCommunity::` namespace in AWS CloudFormation.
The CloudFormation Registry allows customers to create public and private
[resources
types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html),
[modules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/modules.html),
and
[hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/hooks.html).
Modules are authored as templates in either JSON or YAML. Resource types can be authored in Java, Go, Python, or Typescript, using the
[CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CFN
CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudformation-cli.html)
for project setup and testing.

## How to use these extensions

Log in to your AWS account and go to the CloudFormation console. Under Registry
in the menu, select Public extensions. Search under Third Party publishers for
the `AwsCommunity::` namespace. These extensions can be used from any template
you author in a region where they are available and activated. Unlike public
extensions under the `AWS::` namespace, each of these community extensions must
first be activated using the instructions
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html).

### CloudFormation CLI and language plugins

The CloudFormation CLI (`cfn`), not to be confused with the `aws
cloudformation` commands, is used to initialize, build, test, and publish
registry extensions.

https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-cli-python-plugin

### cfn-lint

The CloudFormation linter is an indespensible tool for developing templates. It
does static analysis on your template to make sure it's valid before submitting
it, which saves a lot of wasted time waiting for the service to tell you the
same thing.

https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint

### rain

Rain is what happens when you have cloud formations... Rain is a CLI helper for
CloudFormation that makes it a lot easier to author and deploy stacks. Instead
of needing to string together `aws cloudformation` commands to check the status
of a stack before either creating or updating, rain does all of this with a
simple `deploy` command.

## Publishing packages

(Note that we decided to move these out to a separate repo, so they won't be here much longer)

We publish our python packages in `packages/` to pypi. When we publish a release a workflow is triggered to do the publishing. See the `CD.yml` workflows [here](./github/workflows)

For `cfn-guard-rs` we tag the release with `cfn-guard-rs-vX.X.X`
For `cfn-guard-rs-hook` we tag the release with `cfn-guard-rs-hook-vX.X.X`
